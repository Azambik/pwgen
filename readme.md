--My code--
I decided to take the questions answered by the user and store them in a pw opject. boolean flags were used to determin in the end what character sets to select form. the four character sets were tored in arays and a random element in each one is selected and added the the password array. to select between diferent character set arays aSelecet function was made. the length of the pass word entered by the user is used in the loops of genPassword function to set the pw length and loop through character sets.
